I arrived into SFO Friday evening, and got picked up by my three brothers and dad. Thirty minutes later we were in the city as the sun was setting and we all decided to walk down to the waterfront for what looked like the makings of an epic sunset. We weren't dissappointed and arrived just in time.

The first night was pretty low key after that and I got to catch up on some much needed rest.

**_Day 1:_**

Once we were all up, we headed out for coffee and pastries at a little spot in Ghiradelli Square. At breakfast we agreed on the plan for the day and decided to get out of the city for a drive down Highway 1 towards Pacifica and Half Moon Bay along the coast.

The weather was overcast and chilly most of the morning/afternoon, but the landscape was still very beautiful.

After lunch and about 2 hours of walking around Half Moon Bay State Beach, we headed inland to get some Blue Bottle Coffee and wander around Palo Alto. Blue Bottle Coffee is always on my itinerary when visiting the Bay Area. The Palo Alto location was really unique as it is housed in the Varsity Theatre, which was built in the 1920s and has a cool open courtyard.

Later we played a game of soccer at a local park, and then headed back to SF as the sun was setting. We finished off the night with dinner at an Italian restaurant in the Richmond District.

**_Day 2:_**

The next morning started with...you guessed it, awesome coffee! This time we opted for a place walking distance from my brother's apartment in Russian Hill.

From there we drove to Ocean Beach and the Sutro Baths to walk around. We lucked out as the weather was sunny and warm all over the city that day.

Later in the day, we relaxed for a little bit and watched some college football, and then walked down to a nearby park for some 2 on 2 basketball. Here's one of my brothers attempting to dunk...haha good ups though.

When we got back home, we snuck onto the roof of the apartment to fly my brother's drone. The view from up there really makes you appreciate how big the city of San Francisco is. Also, it doesn't matter how many times I see the Golden Gate Bridge, it's always impressive and worth a photo.
