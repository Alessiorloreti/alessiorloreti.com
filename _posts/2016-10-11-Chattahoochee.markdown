I arrived into SFO Friday evening, and got picked up by my three brothers and dad. Thirty minutes later we were in the city as the sun was setting and we all decided to walk down to the waterfront for what looked like the makings of an epic sunset. We weren't dissappointed and arrived just in time.

Later in the day, we relaxed for a little bit and watched some college football, and then walked down to a nearby park for some 2 on 2 basketball. Here's one of my brothers attempting to dunk...haha good ups though.

When we got back home, we snuck onto the roof of the apartment to fly my brother's drone. The view from up there really makes you appreciate how big the city of San Francisco is. Also, it doesn't matter how many times I see the Golden Gate Bridge, it's always impressive and worth a photo.
