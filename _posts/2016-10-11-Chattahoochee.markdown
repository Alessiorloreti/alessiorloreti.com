Fall has quickly arrived in Georgia, which means it's time to spend more time outdoors enjoying the cooler temperatures and watching the leaves change to their autumn colors. A friend and I decided to go for a hike on a recent Sunday afternoon to take full advantage of the the perfect fall conditions, and also to see how our new pup would do on a hike. My wife and I recently rescued a sweet 15lb Boston Terrier mix dog named Huck, who has what seems like infinite energy, so I wanted to see how he would do around other dogs and if a good hike would tire him out. After 4 miles on the trails and in the sun, everyone was exhausted, except for little Huck! He did amazing on the hike, so I'm happy to say I have a new favorite hiking buddy. Here are some photos from our afternoon hiking along the Chattahoochee.
