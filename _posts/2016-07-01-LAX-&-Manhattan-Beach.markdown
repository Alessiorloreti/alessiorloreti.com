I switched jobs in 2015 and my work trips went from about 2-3 destinations a month, to none. After 10 months with the new job, I finally
got word that they needed me to fly out to our LA office to work on a project. It's not Dubai or Paris or Hong Kong, but I was looking
forward to exploring L.A nonetheless for a couple of days.

I arrived in L.A. Sunday afternoon to partly overcast skies and beautiful 70 degree weather. Since I only had 3 full days in L.A. and
Monday/Tuesday would mostly be spent working all day/eveining, I knew my best chance for getting some photos was Sunday.

My first stop was an In-N-Out on the northside of LAX. I knew there was a park across the street from the restaurant where I would have a
good opportunity to photograph planes coming in to land.

The planes were arriving about every 5 mins, but I mostly held out to shoot the larger ones. I managed to get a Delta A330 and EvA 777.

Next stop was my hotel to drop off my bags, recharge my phone, and Uber to the beach for sunset.

I arrived at Manhattan Beach Pier around 7:30pm, with about an hour left of sun light remaining. Golden hour was full on and I was
cruising up and down the Strand on my Penny Board snapping away.

As the sun was just about to drop below the horizon, I walked down to the water by the pier to get some sunburst shots and try to get the
reflection of the sun off the water.

There were surfers in the water, kids playing on the beach, and even a man proposing to his girlfriend in front of their families.

After the sun set, I walked back up to the Strand and explored the area on my skateboard. The sky was a vibrant rainbow of colors...blue,
purple, green, yellow, orange, red. I stopped and stared up at the palm trees and sky and thought it was very symbolic after the mass
shooting that took place in Orlando earlier that day at a gay nightclub.

I skated some more until my phone died and had to find a Starbucks to charge it up so that I could Uber back to the hotel. It was a short
evening out taking photos but it was good to have a change of scenery and be back close to the beach.
