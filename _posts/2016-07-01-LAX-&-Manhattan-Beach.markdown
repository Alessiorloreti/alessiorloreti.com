I switched jobs in 2015 and my work trips went from about 2-3 destinations a month, to none. After 10 months with the new job, I finally
got word that they needed me to fly out to our LA office to work on a project. It's not Dubai or Paris or Hong Kong, but I was looking
forward to exploring L.A nonetheless for a couple of days.
