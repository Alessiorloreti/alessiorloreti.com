My buddy Jon texted me Friday afternoon to see if I was down to go out that night and take photos. I had been itching to get out and 
take some photos of Midtown, so I texted him back and we made a plan for that night.

Next stop was a parking garage about a block away. We got to the top floor with about 20 minutes before the sun was about to set. The
parking garage offered some cool unobstructed views of the surrounding skyscrapers.

Once the sun went down we walked around the area, eventually ending up at the Midtown Arts Center MARTA station. We only hung around for 
about 15 minutes since it was so hot down there, but we both managed to get some interesting shots of the arriving and departing
trains.

From there we walked back towards Colony Square so Jon could try out his new fisheye on the MIDTOWN sign. As he was getting some shots, I
noticed a bike rack also with the word "Midtown" on it and snapped a couple photos.

We finished off the night in the middle of Peachtree (on a concrete median), getting some photos of the passing traffic and highrise
buildings.

Although the heat of a July night is pretty brutal, I'm glad Jon hit me up to get out and explore. I had a good time chatting with him
about camera gear/settings, future projects, and we both ended up with some pretty decent photos to head home and edit.
