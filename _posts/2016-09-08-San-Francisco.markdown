For Labor Day weekend I decided to head out west and meet my family in San Francisco for a couple days of exploring and enjoying some ~~good~~ ...great food/coffee. Here are some of the photos from the 3 days we spent together.

**_Day 0.5:_**

I arrived into SFO Friday evening, and got picked up by my brothers and dad. As soon as we got to my brother's apartment in the city, we all decided to walk down to the waterfront, as the sun was setting and for what looked like the makings of an epic sunset. We weren't dissappointed and arrived just in time.

**_Day 1:_**

The first night was pretty low key and we all caught up on some much needed rest. Once we awoke, we headed out for coffee and pastries for breakfast at Ghiradelli Square. After that, we agreed on getting out of the city for a drive down Highway 1 towards Pacifica and Half Moon Bay to spend some time along the coast.

The weather was overcast and chilly most of the morning/afternoon, but the landscape was still very beautiful.

After lunch and some time walking around Half Moon Bay State Beach, we headed inland to get some Blue Bottle Coffee and wander around Palo Alto.

We played a game of soccer at a local park, and then headed back to SF as the sun was setting. We finished off the night with dinner at an Italian restaurant in the Richmond District.

**_Day 2:_**

The next morning started with...you guessed it, awesome coffee! This time we opted for a place walking distance from my brothers apartment in Russian Hill.

From there we headed to Ocean Beach and the Sutro Baths. We lucked out as the weather was sunny and warm all over the city that day.

Later in the day, we relaxed for a little bit and watched college football, and then walked down to a nearby park for some 2 on 2 basketball. Here's one of my brothers attempting to dunk...

When we got back home, we snuck onto the roof of the apartment to fly my brother's drone. The view from up there really makes you appreciate how big the city of San Francisco is. Also, it doesn't matter how many times I see the Golden Gate Bridge, it's always impressive and worth a photo.

**_Day 3:_**

And just like that, the trip was pretty much over. I had to get to the airport around noon, so we didn't have time to do much that last morning. We went out for coffee and then made breakfast at home. After packing, we said our goodbyes, and I headed to the airport.

On the way, I asked my brother if we could stop at Treasure Island to get a few final photos of the Bay Bridge and downtown San Francisco.

The weekend flew by way too fast, but it was definitely a much needed break from work and the heat of summer in the South. As always, it was awesome spending time with family and going back to one of my favorite cities in the U.S.

So long San Francisco, now back to Atlanta.
