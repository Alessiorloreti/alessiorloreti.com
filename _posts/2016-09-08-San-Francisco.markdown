For Labor Day weekend I decided to head out west and meet my family in San Francisco for a couple days of exploring and ~~good~~ ...great food/coffee. Here are some of the photos from the 3 days we spent together.

**_Day 0.5:_**

I arrived Friday evening into SFO and as soon as we got to my brothers apartment in the city, we decided to walk a couple blocks down to the water for what looked like the makings of an epic sunset.

**_Day 1:_**

After coffee and pastries in the city, we decided to drive down Highway 1 towards Pacifica and Half Moon Bay to spend some time along the coast.

The weather was pretty overcast and chilly, but the landscape was still very impressive.

After lunch and some time walking around Half Moon Bay State Beach, we headed inland to get some Blue Bottle Coffee and wander around Palo Alto.

After a game of soccer at a local park, we headed back to SF for dinner in the Richmond District.

The next morning started with...you guessed it, awesome coffee! This time we opted for a place walking distance from my brothers apartment in Russian Hill.

From there we headed to Ocean Beach and the Sutro Baths. We lucked out as the weather was sunny and warm all over the city that day.
