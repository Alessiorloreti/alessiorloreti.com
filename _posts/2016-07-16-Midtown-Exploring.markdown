My first stop was the In-N-Out on the northside of LAX. There is a park across the street where I have wanted to photograph planes coming in to land for awhile.

The planes were arriving about every 5 mins, but I mostly held out to shoot the larger ones.

Next stop was my hotel to drop off my bags, recharge my phone, and Uber to the beach for sunset.

I arrived at Manhattan Beach Pier around 7:30pm, with about an hour left of sun light remaining. Golden hour was full on and I was
cruising up and down the Strand on my Penny Board snapping away.

As the sun was just about to drop below the horizon, I walked down to the water by the pier to get some sunburst shots and try to get the
reflection of the sun off the water.

There were surfers in the water, kids playing on the beach, and even a guy proposing to his girlfriend in front of their families.

After the sunset, I walked back up to the Strand and explored the area on my skateboard. The sky was a vibrant rainbow of colors...blue,
green, yellow, orange, and red. I stopped and stared up at the palm trees in front of the sky and thought it was very symbolic after the
mass shooting that took place in Orlando earlier that day at the Pulse nightclub. I sat for a couple minutes and took in the gorgeous
landscape as the last light of the day faded away.

I skated some more until my phone died and had to find a Starbucks to charge it up so that I could Uber back to the hotel. It was a short
evening out taking photos but it was good to have a change of scenery and be back close to the beach.
